- add price alerts
- centralize subscriptions
  - right now i have each widget send their websocket request. however, if 2 widgets rely on the same data there is no need for an extra connection
  - create sub manager which will only subscribe if there are no current connections and unsubscribe when the conenctions are at 0 for a specifc channel
  - some sort of unordered_map with the channel name and number of conenctions
