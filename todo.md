- add price alerts
    - need to build an alert manager
        - we only need one event listener per symbol
        - we need to only subscirbe if an event does not exist yet
        - we also need to store all of the alerts we are wating for in an unordered map keyed on symbol
        - each alert show have a price and if we want to know if the symvol is above or below and if the alert is still valid
        - probably should track active and inactive alerts in seperate structures maybe
    - need an alert widget 
        - should show current alerts 
        - user can add new alerts
        - alerts that have occured maybe we make the color green or something and ones that have not are white?
        - i think we should store all alerts while the app is open 
        - users also need to be able to remove an alert
        - i dont think we need to allow editing since user can remove and add but might look into it at the end
        - need to interface with windows api to play sound which should not be too bad
            - now this program is only for windows
- add in compiler warnings
